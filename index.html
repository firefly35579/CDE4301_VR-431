        </div>
  
        <div id="sub-section-1-header-1">
          <h3>1.1. Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>
            Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) is one of the most critical and life-threatening obstetric emergencies encountered in clinical practice. It is traditionally defined as a blood loss of more than 500 mL following vaginal delivery or more than 1,000 mL following cesarean delivery, with severe PPH involving blood loss greater than 1,500 mL or associated hemodynamic instability (Bienstock et al., 2021). PPH accounts for approximately 27% of all maternal deaths worldwide, making it the leading direct cause of maternal mortality globally (Say et al., 2024). Each year, about 14 million women experience PPH resulting in about 70,000 maternal deaths globally (WHO, 2023). The urgency and complexity of managing PPH require that healthcare professionals, particularly those in obstetrics and gynecology, be well-trained in recognizing early signs of excessive bleeding and executing prompt interventions. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In Singapore, while maternal mortality rates are low compared to global averages, PPH remains a significant cause of maternal morbidity, contributing to emergency hysterectomies, ICU admissions, and long-term complications such as anemia, infection, and psychological trauma (De Silva et al., 2021). Studies have shown that up to 5% of deliveries worldwide result in PPH, with uterine atony being the most common cause, causing approximately 70% of all cases (Wormer et al., 2024).
          </p>
          <p>
            To diagnose PPH, medical staff need to determine a quantitative measure of blood loss during the third stage of labour (WHO, 2023).  The most common method used to assess and meausre this blood loss is visual estimation (WHO, 2023). However, visual estimation is widely considered to be inaccurate because it can mis-estimate blood loss to a large degree, in particular leading to under-estimation at higher volumes of blood loss. The underestimation of blood loss can be approximately 16% to 41%, and can delay the diagnosis of PPH and the administration of life-saving interventions including uterotonic agents, uterine massage, and surgical procedures (Toledo et al.).
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="sub-section-1-header-2">
          <h3>1.2. Background</h3>
          <p>
            Despite its clinical importance, training for PPH recognition and management remains limited and inconsistent across medical institutions (Akter et al., 2022). At the National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS YLLSOM), students often only receive didactic training on PPH; lectures where they focus on theory (A. Kanneganti, personal communication, March 21, 2025). They do not have hands-on training for estimating blood loss, they simply learn from the textbook. Below are some pages from the textbook:
          </p>
          
          <!-- Start of the Textbook Gallery -->
          <div class="gallery-container medical-gallery">
            <button id="prev-textbook" class="gallery-button">←</button>
            <img id="gallery-image-textbook" src="assets/pg177.jpg" alt="Textbook Frame 1">
            <button id="next-textbook" class="gallery-button">→</button>
          </div>
          <p id="gallery-caption-textbook" class="gallery-caption">1 of X</p>

          <p>  
            It is difficult for these lecture sessions to replicate the dynamic, real-time progression of PPH in an actual delivery setting, nor do they provide an objective, feedback-driven platform for blood loss estimation and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, without repeated exposure or the ability to practice in varied clinical contexts, students may struggle to develop confidence and accuracy in identifying when PPH is occurring and how best to respond.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="sub-section-1-header-3"></div>
          <h3>1.3. Novelty and Value Proposition</h3>
          <p>
            Given the high stakes of PPH management and the limitations of current training methods, it is crucial to introduce simulation-based education that can replicate real-world obstetric emergencies. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a promising solution by enabling immersive, repeatable, and feedback-rich experiences for medical students. We propose a VR training simulation focused on blood loss estimation and early PPH detection which can expose students to a range of bleeding scenarios, allowing them to hone their observational skills, make time-sensitive decisions, and gain a deeper understanding of PPH progression and treatment protocols. By incorporating visual cues and instantaneous feedback, the VR simulation will help students learn better and develop proficiency in recognizing and managing PPH effectively. NUS medical students are also given a VR headset so access to a VR simulation to practice the relevant skills when they need will give them better exposure and increase the frequency of practice they can have, ultimately helping enhance their education. The VR simulation will also utilise to-scale assets and give users a better sense of scale and context so that they can more easily relate and internalise their learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            By improving the quality of PPH training through VR, we aim to address the global call for better maternal care and enhance the readiness of future clinicians in managing one of obstetrics’ most dangerous complications. Early recognition and effective intervention not only save lives but also reduce the risk of long-term maternal health consequences, alleviate healthcare burdens, and improve patient confidence in maternal care systems. We hope to help enhance NUS medical students’ decision-making accuracy, knowledge retention, and ultimately contribute to better clinical outcomes for maternal healthcare in Singapore.

          <h3>3.1 Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)</h3>
          <p>
            CLT highlights the critical balance between working memory’s limitations and long-term memory’s capacity to store schemas. Effective learning occurs when instructional designs optimise cognitive load by minimising extraneous demands, enabling learners to focus on intrinsic and germane processes (Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation [CESE], 2017). VR’s immersive and intuitive interfaces uniquely align with CLT principles by presenting complex medical scenarios in an engaging, contextually rich format. In the case of PPH, VR simulations minimise extraneous distractions present in a typical classroom, and direct learners’ attention to mastering essential decision-making processes. The multisensory inputs offered by VR create a highly engaging environment that reinforces cognitive schema acquisition (Fuoad et al., 2022). Such immersive learning environments have been shown to significantly reduce cognitive overload while promoting deeper retention of complex tasks, making VR a powerful tool for integrating CLT into medical education (Andersen et al., 2016).

          <h3>3.2 Embodied Cognition</h3>
          <p>
            Embodied cognition posits that cognitive processing is deeply rooted in the body’s physical interactions with its environment. This theory underscores the importance of active, experiential learning, suggesting that physical engagement enhances the depth and retention of knowledge (Skulmowski, 2018). VR bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and hands-on practice by allowing learners to “inhabit” the learning experience. In this case, managing a simulated PPH case in VR allows students to rehearse life-saving interventions, such as fundal massage and oxytocin administration, within a realistic but safe virtual environment. This hands-on, immersive approach strengthens neural connections associated with procedural tasks, bridging the gap between passive learning and active skill acquisition (Tene et al., 2024). Embodied experiences in VR have been shown to lead to enhanced problem-solving capabilities and long-term retention, emphasising its transformative potential in medical training (Steen et al., 2024).
          </p>
          <p>
            The integration of Cognitive Load Theory and Embodied Cognition forms a robust theoretical foundation for VR-based medical education. By leveraging VR’s immersive capabilities, this approach optimises cognitive resources, engages sensory-motor systems, and fosters structured problem-solving skills. These elements collectively enable medical students to transition from passive theoretical learning to active, experiential mastery, ensuring readiness for real-world clinical challenges and contributing to improved patient care outcomes.

          <h3>4.1 Research Design</h3>
          <p>
            This study employs a quantitative-focused approach to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of VR in enhancing problem-solving skills among medical students. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, with randomisation stratified by variables such as prior clinical exposure and academic standing to ensure comparability between the two groups. The study aims to recruit a minimum of 50 participants, with an equal distribution across the VR and control groups, to achieve statistically meaningful results.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the VR group, participants will receive instruction on PPH management via a VR simulation. This approach emphasises the active acquisition of theoretical knowledge in a practical, dynamic environment.

            In the control group, participants will receive traditional lecture-based instruction, focusing on the theoretical principles of PPH management and problem-solving strategies. This method mirrors the conventional approach in medical education, providing a benchmark for comparing the efficacy of VR-based learning.

          <p>
            To ensure comparability, identical pre- and post-assessments—structured around Polya’s Problem-Solving Framework—will be administered to both groups. In these assessments, participants will work through PPH scenarios in which they must understand the problem, devise a plan, execute that plan, and evaluate the result. The test measures students’ problem-solving efficiency in systematically diagnosing and addressing the underlying cause of haemorrhage.        </p>

          <h3>4.3 Justification of Framework</h3>
          <p>
            George Polya’s four-step framework – understanding the problem, devising a plan, executing the plan, and evaluating the results – provides a structured methodology that mirrors the stepwise nature of clinical decision-making. In high-stakes scenarios like PPH, where prompt and accurate interventions are critical, this systematic approach ensures that learners can methodically address complex challenges. 
          </p>
          <img src="assets/Polya.jpg" alt="Polya's Framework" class="centered-image" />
  
          <p>
            By integrating Polya’s framework into VR training modules, educators can guide students through the cognitive stages of problem-solving, encouraging reflective thinking and adaptive learning. In this case, students first identify abnormal bleeding patterns (understanding), develop a treatment strategy (planning), perform simulated interventions (execution), and assess the patient’s virtual response (evaluation). This iterative process not only enhances clinical reasoning but also builds resilience and adaptability, preparing students to tackle unpredictable medical emergencies with confidence (Alharbi et al., 2024). 
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Moreover, Polya’s framework is particularly relevant for PPH scenarios, where decisions must be made under time constraints, requiring a blend of diagnostic reasoning and procedural accuracy (World Health Organisation [WHO], 2012). Its structured nature facilitates a clear comparison of cognitive and procedural performance across groups, providing actionable insights into the educational value of VR-based training.

          <h2>5. Anticipated Results </h2>
          <p>
            This study hypothesises that participants in the Virtual Reality (VR) group will exhibit superior performance across all evaluated metrics compared to the control group. Specifically, we anticipate the following outcomes:
          </p>
        
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Enhanced Problem-Solving Efficiency:</strong> VR participants are expected to demonstrate an ability to navigate complex scenarios with fewer steps and minimal errors, reflecting enhanced cognitive schema development. The realistic and interactive nature of VR provides a platform allowing learners to internalise systematic approaches to clinical challenges more effectively than traditional lecture-based methods (Plackett et al., 2022). This efficiency is particularly critical in high-pressure situations like PPH, where swift and accurate decisions can significantly impact patient outcomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accelerated Response Times:</strong> Immersive VR environments simulate the urgency of real-world medical emergencies, training participants to process information and make decisions under pressure (Mergen et al., 2024). This hands-on exposure is anticipated to develop quicker cognitive reflexes, better preparing participants to respond promptly and effectively in actual clinical scenarios (Einloft et al., 2024).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduced Dependence on External Hints:</strong> By fostering a deeper understanding of clinical decision-making through experiential learning, VR is expected to boost participants’ confidence and independence. This reduction in reliance on external prompts during problem-solving tasks reflects an increased capacity for autonomous reasoning, a critical competency in unpredictable, high-stakes medical settings.

        <div id="sub-section-6-header-1">
          <h3>6.1 Addressing the Novelty Effect</h3>
          <p>
            The novelty effect refers to the initial cognitive overload and distraction learners may experience when first interacting with new technologies like VR. This effect can divert focus from learning objectives to navigating the unfamiliar technology, thereby diminishing educational outcomes (Miguel-Alonso et al., 2024). To mitigate this challenge, a multi-faceted approach will be employed:
          </p>
        
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Comprehensive Pre-Exposure Training:</strong> A step-by-step tutorial will introduce participants to the VR interface and mechanics, ensuring a seamless transition into the simulation. This preparatory phase will include hands-on practice to familiarise users with navigation, controls, and system interactions, reducing anxiety and cognitive strain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Incremental Immersion Strategy:</strong> The VR simulation will be structured progressively, starting with basic, low-stakes interactions such as clicking a simple button and gradually advancing to more complex interactions such as following a set of guiding hands. This scaffolding approach ensures learners build confidence and competence without feeling overwhelmed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ongoing Facilitator Support:</strong> Dedicated facilitators will be available throughout the simulation sessions to provide real-time assistance, address technical issues, and refocus participants on the educational objectives. Their presence ensures continuous engagement and minimises interruptions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        
          <p>
            These measures not only mitigate the novelty effect but also enhance participants’ readiness to engage deeply with the content, allowing the VR experience to serve as a robust learning platform.
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="sub-section-6-header-2">
