          <h2> 1. Abstract </h2>
          <p>
            The integration of Virtual Reality (VR) into medical education represents a transformative approach to enhancing learning outcomes and student engagement. This study uses Polya’s Problem-Solving Framework to evaluate VR’s effectiveness in improving problem-solving skills among medical students. The instructional VR intervention produced for this study also addresses key educational challenges in teaching postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) management, for which medical students rarely receive hands-on training due to its sensitive and emergent nature (G. Arundhati, personal communication, 8 November 2024). By comparing improvements in problem-solving skills between participants who received VR-based training and traditional lecture-based instruction, this study aims to validate VR’s role in bridging theoretical and practical learning gaps in medical education. The findings will offer empirical evidence supporting the integration of VR into curricula and propose a replicable framework for its broader adoption across critical training domains.        </p>

          <h3>2.1. Objectives and Scope</h3>
          <p>
            The integration of Virtual Reality (VR) into education represents a transformative opportunity to advance learning methodologies, offering immersive and experiential environments that are difficult to replicate within traditional teaching methods. While VR has gained recognition for enhancing engagement, its quantifiable impact on cognitive skills, such as problem-solving, remains underexplored (Yang et al., 2024). Most studies emphasise qualitative benefits like user satisfaction, with limited attention to the deeper cognitive transformations that immersive technologies can facilitate. This project bridges that gap by critically evaluating VR’s effectiveness in improving problem-solving abilities within the medical context of PPH.
          </p>
          <p>
  PPH – a leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide – presents unique pedagogical challenges due to its emergency nature, high-pressure decision-making requirements, and unpredictability in clinical settings (McLintock, 2020). Traditional teaching approaches, such as theoretical lectures and case-based discussions, are inadequate for preparing students to handle the dynamic, real-world complexities of PPH management. By grounding this study in PPH, the project not only highlights VR’s potential to address a critical educational bottleneck but also pioneers a replicable framework for integrating immersive technologies into medical education.
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="sub-section-2-header-2">
          <h3>2.2. Context of the Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Medical education demands a training approach that equips practitioners with advanced problem-solving skills, such as rapid decision-making and adaptive reasoning, necessary for navigating high-pressure, real-world emergencies (Sedlár, 2020). PPH exemplifies these challenges as a condition requiring swift and precise interventions to prevent maternal death. Globally, PPH accounts for nearly 27% of maternal mortality, making its management a critical competency for healthcare professionals (World Health Organisation [WHO], 2022). However, due to its sporadic occurrence and sensitive nature, medical students rarely have the opportunity to observe or participate in real-life PPH cases, hindering experiential learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditional teaching methods fall short of bridging this gap. Theoretical lectures, while essential for foundational knowledge, fail to replicate the time-sensitive decision-making required in emergency scenarios. Without hands-on experience, students may lack the confidence and practical competence to manage such cases effectively (Alrashidi et al., 2023). VR offers an innovative solution by providing a realistic, high-fidelity PPH simulation that is controlled, repeatable, and risk-free. This allows students to practise essential skills, refine their cognitive and procedural abilities, and engage in real-world decision-making processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            VR’s immersive and interactive nature addresses the core limitations of traditional pedagogy. By replicating the emotional and cognitive pressures of managing emergencies, VR fosters an experiential learning paradigm that aligns with modern educational theories such as constructivist and situated learning frameworks (Aiello et al., 2012). These frameworks emphasise active participation and real-world context as critical components of skill acquisition. Furthermore, VR provides a scalable and equitable training solution, enabling consistent exposure to high-stakes scenarios without reliance on unpredictable clinical opportunities. By integrating VR into medical education, this study seeks to enhance student preparedness, reduce clinical errors, and ultimately improve patient outcomes, setting a precedent for immersive technologies across other critical training domains.

          <h3>3.1 Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)</h3>
          <p>
            CLT highlights the critical balance between working memory’s limitations and long-term memory’s capacity to store schemas. Effective learning occurs when instructional designs optimise cognitive load by minimising extraneous demands, enabling learners to focus on intrinsic and germane processes (Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation [CESE], 2017). VR’s immersive and intuitive interfaces uniquely align with CLT principles by presenting complex medical scenarios in an engaging, contextually rich format. In the case of PPH, VR simulations minimise extraneous distractions present in a typical classroom, and direct learners’ attention to mastering essential decision-making processes. The multisensory inputs offered by VR create a highly engaging environment that reinforces cognitive schema acquisition (Fuoad et al., 2022). Such immersive learning environments have been shown to significantly reduce cognitive overload while promoting deeper retention of complex tasks, making VR a powerful tool for integrating CLT into medical education (Andersen et al., 2016).

        <div id="sub-section-3-header-2">
          <h3>3.2 Embodied Cognition</h3>
          <p>
            Embodied cognition posits that cognitive processing is deeply rooted in the body’s physical interactions with its environment. This theory underscores the importance of active, experiential learning, suggesting that physical engagement enhances the depth and retention of knowledge (Skulmowski, 2018). VR bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and hands-on practice by allowing learners to “inhabit” the learning experience. In this case, managing a simulated PPH case in VR allows students to rehearse life-saving interventions, such as fundal massage and oxytocin administration, within a realistic but safe virtual environment. This hands-on, immersive approach strengthens neural connections associated with procedural tasks, bridging the gap between passive learning and active skill acquisition (Tene et al., 2024). Embodied experiences in VR have been shown to lead to enhanced problem-solving capabilities and long-term retention, emphasising its transformative potential in medical training (Steen et al., 2024).
          </p>
          <p>
            The integration of Cognitive Load Theory and Embodied Cognition forms a robust theoretical foundation for VR-based medical education. By leveraging VR’s immersive capabilities, this approach optimises cognitive resources, engages sensory-motor systems, and fosters structured problem-solving skills. These elements collectively enable medical students to transition from passive theoretical learning to active, experiential mastery, ensuring readiness for real-world clinical challenges and contributing to improved patient care outcomes.

          <h3>4.1 Research Design</h3>
          <p>
            This study employs a quantitative-focused approach to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of VR in enhancing problem-solving skills among medical students. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, with randomisation stratified by variables such as prior clinical exposure and academic standing to ensure comparability between the two groups. The study aims to recruit a minimum of 50 participants, with an equal distribution across the VR and control groups, to achieve statistically meaningful results.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the VR group, participants will receive instruction on PPH management via a VR simulation. This approach emphasises the active acquisition of theoretical knowledge in a practical, dynamic environment.

            In the control group, participants will receive traditional lecture-based instruction, focusing on the theoretical principles of PPH management and problem-solving strategies. This method mirrors the conventional approach in medical education, providing a benchmark for comparing the efficacy of VR-based learning.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            To ensure comparability, identical pre- and post-assessments—structured around Polya’s Problem-Solving Framework—will be administered to both groups. In these assessments, participants will work through PPH scenarios in which they must understand the problem, devise a plan, execute that plan, and evaluate the result. The test measures students’ problem-solving efficiency in systematically diagnosing and addressing the underlying cause of haemorrhage.        </p>

          <h3>4.3 Justification of Framework</h3>
          <p>
            George Polya’s four-step framework – understanding the problem, devising a plan, executing the plan, and evaluating the results – provides a structured methodology that mirrors the stepwise nature of clinical decision-making. In high-stakes scenarios like PPH, where prompt and accurate interventions are critical, this systematic approach ensures that learners can methodically address complex challenges. 
          </p>
          <img src="assets/Polya.jpg" alt="Polya's Framework" class="centered-image" />
  
          <p>
            By integrating Polya’s framework into VR training modules, educators can guide students through the cognitive stages of problem-solving, encouraging reflective thinking and adaptive learning. In this case, students first identify abnormal bleeding patterns (understanding), develop a treatment strategy (planning), perform simulated interventions (execution), and assess the patient’s virtual response (evaluation). This iterative process not only enhances clinical reasoning but also builds resilience and adaptability, preparing students to tackle unpredictable medical emergencies with confidence (Alharbi et al., 2024). 
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Moreover, Polya’s framework is particularly relevant for PPH scenarios, where decisions must be made under time constraints, requiring a blend of diagnostic reasoning and procedural accuracy (World Health Organisation [WHO], 2012). Its structured nature facilitates a clear comparison of cognitive and procedural performance across groups, providing actionable insights into the educational value of VR-based training.

          <h2>5. Anticipated Results </h2>
          <p>
            This study hypothesises that participants in the Virtual Reality (VR) group will exhibit superior performance across all evaluated metrics compared to the control group. Specifically, we anticipate the following outcomes:
          </p>
        
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Enhanced Problem-Solving Efficiency:</strong> VR participants are expected to demonstrate an ability to navigate complex scenarios with fewer steps and minimal errors, reflecting enhanced cognitive schema development. The realistic and interactive nature of VR provides a platform allowing learners to internalise systematic approaches to clinical challenges more effectively than traditional lecture-based methods (Plackett et al., 2022). This efficiency is particularly critical in high-pressure situations like PPH, where swift and accurate decisions can significantly impact patient outcomes.
